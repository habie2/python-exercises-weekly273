Write a Python program to store into a variable the string: Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are. It must be stored in a way that when printing it we obtain the following specific format:
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
      how I wonder what you are!
             Up above the world so high,
             like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
      how I wonder what you are.
