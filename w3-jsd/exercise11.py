@date: 26/09/2021

Using the previously declared variable and the String slicing operators create three variables, the first one will contain Twinkle, twinkle, little star, the second one Up above the world so high and the third one how I wonder what you are. Print them.
"""
var1= ('Twinkle, twinkle, little star,')
var2 = ('\n\t\tUp above the world so high,')
var3 = ('\n\thow I wonder what you are.')

print(var1)
print(var2)
print(var3)

"""
Conclusion:

It prints an extra \n because the print instructions are in different lines.
