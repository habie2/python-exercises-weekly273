@title: excercise 4. Changing the type of a variable
@author: Javier Sanz Diaz
@date: 24 Sept 2021

Declare and initialize an integer variable. In the next line change its content so now it stores ‘hello’. Is that
possible? What is the name of the Python property allowing it?
"""
var1 = int(7)
var1 = 'hello'

"""
Conclusion:
Yes, it is posible because Python is a dynamic type lenguage, then we can 
change the type of the variables.
