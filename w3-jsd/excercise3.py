@title: excercise 3. Changing the value of a variable
@author: Javier Sanz Diaz
@date: 24 Sept 2021

Declare and initialize a variable. Next, in a new sentence, change the value of the variable. Is it possible?
Does the type of the variable make any difference? Print both the initial and the new values on the screen
"""

var1 = 3
print(var1)

var1 = 4
print(var1)

"""
Conclusion:
The program prints the last value that is given to the variable, and because of 
that if we give the instruction of printing before declaring the new value of 
the variable it prints the 3 and after, the 4.
