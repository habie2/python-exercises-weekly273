    "# Intro to OO (object orientation)\n",
    "* As we have seen, in addition to code reuse and implementation hiding, functions allow to perform decomposition. For small programs decomposing them into functions is usually enough to have a clear and easy to modify code. \n",
    "\n",
    "* But when working with complex programs decomposition into functions is not enough, we need to perform an extra level of decomposition: when don't usually put all the code in a single file, but divide it among several ones. There will be many files where functions are declared and a *main* file where the functions are invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    ">* Each of these files is usually called a *module*\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are two criteria that can be used to group functions into modules:\n",
    "\n",
    ">* Grouping the functions by functionality: functions that perform similar tasks are put together. As an example, in the final project we would create a module for all the functions moving characters, another one for functions drawing things, another for functions checking collisions and so on. This is known as **structured programming** or **modular programming**: functions are grouped into modules taking into account what they do.\n",
    "\n",
    ">* Grouping functions by the entity they refer to. In the final project we would put together all the functions related to Mario. Another module would contain all the functions related to the enemies. Another one could contain all the functions related to the board and so on. This is known as **object oriented** programming (OO).\n",
    "\n",
    "* OO can be seen as an evolution of structured programming, but it is a different approach: we focus on entities/objects that are relevant. In OO we put together not only the functions that are related to the same entity but also the variables related to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the final project we would use a module to put all the variables and functions related to Mario, another for the enemies, etc. In OO:\n",
    "\n",
    ">* each module is called a *Class*\n",
    ">* variables characterizing each object inside a class are called *atributtes* or *fields*\n",
    ">* functions related to an object are called *methods*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Following an OO approach we analyze the problem in terms of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tEntities that appear in our problem (classes/objects)\n",
    "2.\tCharacteristics of those entities or information we need to store related to them (data attributes or fields)\n",
    "3.\tThings that those entities can do (methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Classes\n",
    "* As a first approach a class can be seen as a kind of generic dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    ">* Remember the 3 dictionaries *mike*, *peter* and *maria* of exercises of a previous week. Even if their structure is equal we need to define them 3 times\n",
    "\n",
    "* A class is like an skeleton to create objects: is like a generic definition of the variables (which we will call attributes or fields) and the functions (which we will call methods) that an object will have\n",
    "* To define a new class we use `class NameOfTheClass`\n",
    "* Naming conventions for class names: upper camel case (see in the above line an example of a correct class name)\n",
    "* All the variables I declare inside a class are called attributes or fields: they contain the information that is important for that object\n",
    "* Name rules for attributes names: same as for variables (`this_is_a_valid_attribute_name`)\n",
    "* It is recommended to put the class in its own file, do not use the same file for different classes nor include any other function in that file"
